The categories represent intervals along\nsome continuous distribution. The implied CDFs of these distributions will (almost) always cross\nwhen estimated using large samples. Therefore some monotonic transformation of the utility function\nwill reverse the ranking. We provide several examples and a formal proof.

Consequently,\n\nit is\n\nimpossible to use such data to make scienti(cid:133)cally valid statements of the form (cid:147)people in\n\ncountry A are, on average, happier\n\nthan people in country B(cid:148) or\n\nthat (cid:147)married men are\n\nhappier than single men(cid:148) unless we believe that we know a great deal about the underlying\n\ndistribution of happiness.\n\nOur argument is simple. When placing themselves on a happiness scale that consists of\n\na small number of points, people place their happiness or utility in a range.1 For example,\n\nthey describe themselves as (cid:147)very happy(cid:148) if their utility exceeds some critical value. Oswald\n\n(2008) refers to this as the reporting function. Any comparison of two groups presumes that\n\nthe cuto⁄s for the groups are identical.\n\nIf not, comparing the groups would be tantamount\n\nto declaring group A happier than group B because the proportion of As declaring them-\n\nselves (cid:147)quite happy(cid:148)was greater than the proportion of Bs declaring themselves (cid:147)ecstatically\n\nhappy.(cid:148)\n\nIf,\n\nfor example, we have a scale with three categories\n\n(two cuto⁄s), we can, without\n\napparent\n\nloss of generality, normalize the cuto⁄s\n\nto be 0 and 1: Given some belief about\n\nthe full underlying distribution,\n\nsuch as that it is logistic or normal, we can estimate two\n\nparameters\n\n(e.g.\n\nthe mean and variance) of\n\nthe distribution from the distribution of\n\nthe\n\nresponses across categories.\n\nSince we can calculate the mean, it might appear that we can compare average happiness.\n\nHowever,\n\njust as monotonic transformations of\n\nthe utility function do not change choices\n\nunder a revealed preference model of utility, monotonic transformations do not alter\n\nthe\n\ncategory into which expressed utility or happiness falls. Therefore, unless the distribution\n\nof\n\nresponses across\n\ncategories\n\nenables us\n\nto conclude\n\nthat one underlying distribution is\n\ngreater than the other in the sense of (cid:133)rst-order stochastic dominance, we cannot order the\n\nmeans. However, we will not be able to establish (cid:133)rst-order\n\nstochastic dominance of\n\nthe\n\nunderlying distributions unless the estimated variances are identical, which is an essentially\n\nzero-probability event. Moreover, even if our estimates of the variance are identical, since\n\n1 There is a literature (e.g.\nFrey and Stutzer, 2000)\nthat distinguishes between utility as measured by\nrevealed preference and happiness as\nreported in surveys. We view the underlying concepts as\nthe same.\nWhether happiness or utility should be measured by revealed preference/willingness to pay or self-reports is\na separate issues. Our point is merely that regardless of how utility or happiness is elicited, we cannot know\nmore than the ranking of happiness.\n\n1\n\n\x0c', 'both are merely estimates sub ject to error, our posterior that they are identical must still\n\nbe 0.\n\nOur argument is related to Oswald(cid:146)s discussion of the reporting function.\n\nIn an interesting\n\nexperiment, he asks sub jects to report their height on a continuous scale from 0 to 10. He\n\n(cid:133)nds that when the sample is split by sex, the response on the scale is roughly linear in actual\n\nheight. There is, of course, between respondent variation, but we will mostly abstract from\n\nbetween person di⁄erences in the reporting function in what follows.\n\nInstead, we argue that\n\nthere is a fundamental di⁄erence between height and happiness. The underlying variable\n\nheight is measured on an interval scale. Regardless of whether the respondent uses metric\n\nor\n\nimperial measures,\n\nthe reporting function will have the same shape. But happiness\n\nis\n\nordinal.\n\nIt is as if we could not agree whether height should be measured in centimeters, the\n\nlog of centimeters or the exponential of centimeters.\n\nIn principle,\n\nthis problem can be solved if we are willing to tie the happiness\n\nscale to\n\nsome outcome measure. Bond and Lang (2014) develop interval measures of achievement by\n\ntying test scores to eventual completed education and to the associated expected wages. But\n\nas the parallel with their analysis of test scores shows, the conclusions we reach may depend\n\non whether we relate the underlying happiness measure to the probability of committing\n\nsuicide or some other outcome. Moreover\n\nit\n\nis not clear\n\nto us why in this case we would\n\nnot prefer to measure the related outcomes directly. As discussed in section four, regardless\n\nof the concerns we raise about the measurement of happiness,\n\nthe evidence is strong that\n\nMoving to Opportunity reduced symptoms of depression and improved other measures of\n\npsychological well-being.\n\nThe alternative approach, which is\n\nthe one we will emphasize,\n\nis\n\nto place restrictions\n\non the distribution of happiness\n\nin the population. However,\n\nthis,\n\ntoo,\n\nraises di¢ culties.\n\nOur beliefs about what distributions are plausible are likely to depend on our beliefs about,\n\namong other things, the marginal utility of income. Yet, the relation between happiness and\n\nincome is one of the key areas of debate in happiness research.\n\nIn the next\n\nsection, we present a series of\n\nsimple examples. We show (cid:133)rst\n\nthat even\n\nif happiness is normally distributed, shifting respondents from (cid:147)not too happy(cid:148) to (cid:147)pretty\n\nhappy(cid:148) can lower our estimate of average happiness. We then provide an example which\n\nappears to avoid this problem: the distribution of responses over the three categories is higher\n\nin the sense of (cid:133)rst-order stochastic dominance, and estimated mean utility for the group\n\nwith more positive responses\n\nis higher. However, at one point\n\nin the utility distribution,\n\na substantial minority of the second group has higher utility than the members in the (cid:133)rst\n\ngroup. A simple monotonic transformation of the utility function (or happiness distribution)\n\n(cid:133)ts the data equally well but reverses the comparison of mean utilities. Finally, we further\n\n2\n\n\x0c', 'show that when mean happiness is estimated assuming happiness is normally distributed, a\n\ncommon implicit assumption, one of two simple exponential transformations can reverse any\n\nreported happiness gap.\n\nIn the third section we prove our main result:\n\nit is (almost) never possible to rank the\n\nmean happiness of two groups when the data are reported on a discrete ordinal scale. We\n\napply this result,\n\nin section four, to three (cid:133)ndings from the happiness literature:\n\nthe e⁄ect\n\nof Moving to Opportunity on happiness (Ludwig et.\n\nal, 2013);\n\nthe decline in the relative\n\nhappiness of women despite the dramatic progress they have made economically and socially\n\nsince the 1970s (Stevenson and Wolfers, 2009), and the Easterlin paradox (Easterlin, 1973).\n\nWe also investigate the impact of di⁄erent distributional assumptions on comparisons more\n\ngenerally, by looking at the rank order of mean happiness by country.\n\nIn the (cid:133)fth and (cid:133)nal\n\nsection we discuss whether it is possible to weaken our result. We conclude that we can do\n\nso only under (perhaps overly) strong assumptions although we hold out some hope for a\n\nconsensus on plausible restrictions on the happiness distribution which would permit strong\n\nconclusions in some cases.\n\n2\n\nSome Simple Examples\n\nSuppose we ask a large number of people belonging to two groups to assess their happiness\n\non a 3-point scale, and they respond as shown in example 1.\n\nExample 1\n\nGroup A\n\nGroup B\n\nVery happy\n\nPretty happy\n\nNot too happy\n\n20\n\n25\n\n55\n\n15\n\n30\n\n55\n\nThe responses\n\nin group A are higher\n\nthan those in group B in the sense of (cid:133)rst-order\n\nstochastic dominance so that regardless of the values assigned to the three categories, two of\n\nwhich are in any event mere normalizations, group A will have higher average happiness than\n\ngroup B does.2 However,\n\nincreasingly researchers recognize that the three categories capture\n\n2We\nfocus on what we view as\nthe more\nsophisticated approach in this\nliterature which views\nthese\ncategories as capturing three parts of a continuum. We note, however,\nthat\nis common for\nresearchers\nto\nassign the values 0, 1 and 2 to the three categories,\nin which case, group A would have mean happiness .65\nwhile group B would have mean happiness of only .6. Alternatively, they may perform a linear transformation\nby subtracting by the mean and dividing by the variance. This has no substantive impact on the results.\nThese approaches assume that\nthe three points on the scale represent known points on an interval\nscale,\n\n3\n\n\x0c', 'a continuum. Therefore they are likely to estimate underlying happiness using ordered logit\n\nor probit.\n\nFor a normal distribution of happiness with mean (cid:22) and standard deviation\n\n(cid:27) , textbook ordered probit will estimate (cid:22)=(cid:27) . Di⁄erent computer packages use somewhat\n\ndi⁄erent normalizations to identify the model. We will use Stata which sets the constant term\n\nequal to zero and the variance to 1. Stata informs us that group B is .07 standard deviations\n\nless happy than group A if we use ordered probit.\n\nand about .08 standard deviations less\n\nhappy if we use ordered logit.\n\nBut this conclusion is problematic because it assumes that the distribution of happiness\n\ndi⁄ers between the\n\ntwo groups only through a shift\n\nin the mean.\n\nIt\n\nis highly unlikely\n\nthat a shift\n\nin the mean would induce only a shift between the\n\ntop two categories and\n\nnot one between the bottom two categories.\n\nIndeed this cannot happen with either\n\nthe\n\nnormal or\n\nlogistic distribution.\n\nIf\n\nthere were\n\nroughly 400 observations\n\nin each group, a\n\nmaximum likelihood estimator for either a normal or logistic distribution would reject the\n\nnull hypothesis that the distributions di⁄er only due to a shift in their mean.\n\nOf course, we could estimate the ordered probit or logit separately for the two groups,\n\nbut this makes it di¢ cult to interpret the di⁄erence. When estimated on a single group with\n\nno explanatory variables, normalizing the constant\n\nto 0; as\n\nin Stata,\n\nsets\n\nthe mean equal\n\nto 0.\n\nTherefore, we cannot (cid:133)nd a di⁄erence in mean happiness between the two groups.\n\nInstead, we would conclude that for some unfathomable reason, members of group B declare\n\nthemselves very happy only when their happiness exceeds 1.04 standard deviations above\n\nthe mean while members of group A are very happy as long as their happiness exceeds .84\n\nstandard deviations above the mean although both groups declare themselves not too happy\n\nif their happiness is less than .13 deviations above the mean.\n\nNeedless to say, this is an unsatisfactory conclusion. The normalizations rule out di⁄er-\n\nences in the true distributions of happiness, the very phenomenon we are trying to investigate.\n\nA more reasonable assumption is that the members of groups A and B de(cid:133)ne the categories\n\nof happiness similarly but have both di⁄erent means and standard deviations of happiness.\n\nWithout loss of generality (under the normality assumption), we set the cuto⁄ between (cid:147)not\n\ntoo happy(cid:148) and (cid:147)pretty happy(cid:148) to 0 and the cuto⁄ between the latter category and (cid:147)very\n\nhappy(cid:148) to 1.\n\nwhich,\nit will be clear we view as\nincorrect. There are even cases where such scales have been treated as\nratio scales: (cid:147)...\nthe data revealed that those making $55,000 were just 9 percent more satis(cid:133)ed than those\nmaking $25,000.(cid:148) (Dunn and Norton, 2013, p. xiv)\n\n4\n\n\x0c', 'Given normality, we solve\n\n(cid:8) (cid:18) (cid:0)(cid:22)\n\n(cid:8) (cid:18) 1 (cid:0) (cid:22)\n(cid:27)\n\n(cid:27) (cid:19)\n(cid:19)\n\n=\n\n:55\n\n=\n\n:80\n\n(1)\n\n(2)\n\nfor group A and similarly for group B except that we replace :80 with :85:\n\nWe (cid:133)nd that average utility is actually lower for group A at (cid:0):18 than for group B which\nhas average utility (cid:0):14:3\nTo gain some\nintuition into this\n\nseemingly perverse\n\nconsider a more\n\nresult,\n\nextreme\n\nsituation portrayed in example 2.\n\nIn this case in both groups 55% are (cid:147)not too happy(cid:148) but\n\nthe remaining 45% of group A are (cid:147)very happy(cid:148) whereas their counterparts in group B are\n\nonly (cid:147)pretty happy.(cid:148)Given a normal distribution, the only way for no one to have happiness\n\nbetween 0 and 1 is for the variance to be in(cid:133)nite. With more observations to the left of 0\n\nthan to the right of it, as variance goes to in(cid:133)nity, mean utility goes to minus in(cid:133)nity. So, on\n\naverage, group A is in(cid:133)nitely unhappy.\n\nIn contrast, when nobody reports being (cid:147)very happy,(cid:148)\n\nthe variance must be near zero. As the variance goes to zero, all observations are clustered\n\nvery close to zero. Even though somewhat more people (cid:133)nd themselves with happiness just\n\nbelow zero than just above it, they are all so close to zero that mean happiness among group\n\nB is also very close to zero.\n\nExample 2\n\nGroup A\n\nGroup B\n\nVery happy\n\nPretty happy\n\nNot too happy\n\n45\n\n0\n\n55\n\n0\n\n45\n\n55\n\nAs\n\nthe example may suggest, and it\n\nis\n\nstraightforward to show, with the normal and\n\nlogistic distributions, perverse examples arise when the median response lies at one of the\n\nextremes.\n\nIn the happiness data for the United States, the median generally lies in the middle\n\ncategory. However, the normal and logistic distributions are both symmetric distributions.\n\nAsymmetric distributions can produce di⁄erent results.\n\nEven if estimated mean happiness changes in the same direction as the movement among\n\ncategories,\n\nit will rarely be the case that the distributions of happiness can be ranked in the\n\nsense of (cid:133)rst-order stochastic dominance. Consider example 3. Again group B appears to\n\n3 For the logistic distribution the means are -.17 and -.13.\n\n5\n\n\x0c', 'be happier than group A.\n\nBut let us assume that happiness is logistically distributed and\n\nnormalize the cuto⁄s to 0 and 1 as before.\n\nNow our estimate of mean happiness for group\n\nB (:61) is indeed above the estimated mean for group A (:50) ; but the spread coe¢ cient is\n\nalso larger (:42 v :36) so that the happiness distributions cross at the 14th percentile. The\n\nresults if we instead assume that happiness is normally distributed are similar.\n\nExample 3\n\nGroup A\n\nGroup B\n\nVery happy\n\nPretty happy\n\nNot too happy\n\n:2\n\n:6\n\n:2\n\n:28\n\n.53\n\n.19\n\nAt (cid:133)rst blush this may not seem problematic. Although neither group is happier in the\n\nsense of (cid:133)rst-order\n\nstochastic dominance, we can still\n\nsay, using either distribution,\n\nthat\n\ngroup B is happier on average.\n\nUnfortunately,\n\nthis\n\nconclusion relies on the assumption\n\nthat we know the true distribution. Any monotonic transformation of the utility function\n\nis also a legitimate utility function. And given that the distributions cross, we can always\n\nde(cid:133)ne a new utility function/happiness distribution that (cid:133)ts the data equally well and for\n\nwhich the conclusion about mean utility is reversed.\n\nIn example 3, starting from the normal\n\ndistribution, we can rede(cid:133)ne all utilities below -.163 to be\n\nu(cid:3) = c (u + :163) (cid:0) :163:\n\n(3)\n\nFor c su¢ ciently positive, the estimates of average utility will be reversed.\n\nIn fact, perverse examples can even come from standard distributions. Suppose that we\n\nused ordinal data to estimate an underlying happiness distribution assuming normality.\n\nIf we\n\nnormalize the cut-points to 0 and 1, we will obtain a parameter for the mean, (cid:22); and standard\n\ndeviation, (cid:27) . Suppose we instead estimated a log-normal distribution, by transforming the\n\nutilities by eX . Our new mean is\n\ne(cid:22)+:5(cid:27)2\n\nIf we are comparing two groups, one of which has a higher mean and the other a higher\n\nvariance, this transformation alone could reverse the ranking obtained by the normal distri-\n\nbution.\n\nIf not, we can raise the cut-point from 1 to c. This is equivalent to multiplying our\n\ndata by c and thus would have no impact on the direction of\n\nthe gaps when we estimate\n\nwith the normal. However, the mean under the log-normal transformation becomes\n\n(cid:22) = ec(cid:22)+:5c2 (cid:27)2\n\n6\n\n(4)\n\n\x0c', 'There then will always be a c large enough to reverse the ranking.\n\nWhat if one group has both a higher mean and higher variance when estimated normally?\n\nWe\n\ncan then transform the data by (cid:0)e(cid:0)cX to be\nhappiness becomes\n\nleft-skewed log-normal.\n\nThe mean of\n\n(cid:22) = (cid:0)e(cid:0)c(cid:22)+:5c2 (cid:27)2\n\n(5)\n\nwhich is decreasing in (cid:27) . Thus there must be some c that will reverse the gap.\n\nIt should\n\nbe noted that in both cases these are just simple monotonic transformations of the utility\n\nfunction. Since happiness is ordinal, these transformations represent the responses equally\n\nwell.4\n\nThere is a risk that our criticism will be confused with one that is trite.\n\nIt is, of course,\n\npossible to argue that even though a lower proportion of group A than of group B is very\n\nhappy, the As in this group are much happier than the Bs or that the unhappy Bs are much\n\nmore unhappy than the unhappy As. But our argument is di⁄erent. The allocation of the\n\nresponses across\n\nthe three categories\n\nstrongly suggests\n\nthat\n\nthe variance of utility di⁄ers\n\nbetween the two groups. Therefore, one of the above possibilities should be recognized as\n\nhighly likely.\n\nOur focus is on reversals in the estimation of means. However, there is a small but growing\n\nliterature discussed below that analyzes the dispersion of happiness.\n\nIt\n\nis straightforward\n\nto generate plausible\n\nexamples\n\nin which di⁄erent assumptions about\n\nthe distribution of\n\nhappiness lead to di⁄erent conclusions about relative variances. However, we make no claim\n\nthat there is always an easy transformation that generates such a reversal.\n\nFinally, we note\n\nthat\n\nthe\n\nexamples do not\n\nrequire\n\nthat utility be unbounded.\n\nEven\n\nif we believed that utility is uniformly distributed over\n\nsome range,\n\nin all\n\nthree examples\n\nthe cumulative distributions of the utilities of the two groups would cross. However, with\n\nbounded utility,\n\nit is also possible to construct generic examples where the cdfs do not cross.\n\n3\n\nThe General Argument\n\nAssumption 1 Utility u is unbounded.\n\nAssumption 2\n\nThe cumulative distribution function F (u) is continuous with F 0 (u) > 0:\n\nAssumption 3\n\nThe cumulative distribution function can be written as a function of (u (cid:0) m) =s\nwhere u is the utility level, m is a measure of central tendency and s is a measure of spread.\n\n4 It is worth noting that our analysis stands in sharp contrast with Hammond, Liberini and Proto (2011)\nwho accept Pareto superiority as a normative principle but view stochastic dominance of sub jective well-being\nas reported in categories as a necessary and su¢ cient condition for Pareto superiority.\n\n7\n\n\x0c', 'In the case of the normal, m is the mean, s is the standard deviation. For the Cauchy\n\ndistribution m is the median or mode, and s is a transformation of the entropy. Of course,\n\nin the case of the Cauchy distribution,\n\nit would not be meaningful to try to estimate mean\n\nutility. While not all distributions satisfying assumptions 1 and 2 will also satisfy assumption\n\n3, depending on how one de(cid:133)nes (cid:147)standard,(cid:148) most or all standard distributions do.

Motivated by this idea and the positive results of the Gautreaux\n\ndesegregation program in Chicago,6 the Moving-to-Opportunity experiment targeted families\n\nliving in public housing in high poverty areas. Eligible families were invited to apply for the\n\nchance to receive a Section 8 housing (rental assistance) voucher. Applicants were randomly\n\nassigned into three groups: no voucher (Control group), Section 8 voucher that could only\n\nbe used in an area with a poverty rate below 10% (Experimental group), and a standard\n\nSection 8 voucher (Section 8 group).\n\nThe program has been assessed at multiple stages.7 A long-term follow-up (Ludwig et al,\n\n2012, 2013) emphasizes that sub jects in the experimental group were substantially happier\n\nthan those in the control group. We reexamine the evidence for this conclusion.\n\nThe participants in the long-term MTO evaluation study were asked (cid:147)Taken all together,\n\nhow would you say things are these days (cid:150) would you say that you are very happy, pretty\n\nhappy, or not too happy?(cid:148) The authors focus on the e⁄ect on the distribution of responses\n\nacross\n\ncategories.\n\nNothing we write below can or will\n\ncontradict\n\nthe (cid:133)nding that MTO\n\nincreases the proportion of\n\nindividuals who report that they are (cid:147)very happy(cid:148) and reduces\n\nthe proportion who say they are (cid:147)not too happy.(cid:148)If these are the socially relevant categories,\n\nsA = sB = s: Then bsA !d N (cid:0)s; (cid:27)2\nA (cid:1) and bsB !d N (cid:0)s; (cid:27)2\nB (cid:1) :\n\n5 The intuition behind this\nis\nrelatively straightforward. Needless\nto say,\nif\nthe true variances are not\nequal, then asymptotically the probability that the estimates di⁄er by less than " goes to 0 as the samples\nbecome\nlarge.\nSuppose, however,\nthat\nDe(cid:133)ne (cid:11) = bsA (cid:0) bsB : Then since bsA and bsB are asymptotically independent normals, (cid:11) !d N (cid:0)0; (cid:27)2 (cid:1) where\n(cid:27) (cid:17) ((cid:27)A + (cid:27)B ):5 : The asymptotic density at (cid:11) = 0 is (2(cid:25))(cid:0):5 (cid:27)(cid:0)1 : Since the density is maximized at 0; the\nprobability that (cid:11) falls in the range (cid:0)"(cid:27) < (cid:11) < "(cid:27) is less than 2"(cid:27) (cid:0)2(cid:25)(cid:27)2 (cid:1)(cid:0):5\n= (2=(cid:25)):5 " which can be made\narbitrarily small for any sequence of (cid:27) approaching 0: We are grateful to Zhongjun Qu for providing us with\nthis argument.\n6 The Gautreaux program came out of a court-ordered desegration program in Chicago in the 1970s. See\nRosenbaum (1995) for a detailed analysis.\n7 For the earliest evaluation, see Katz, Kling, and Liebman (2001). For an intermediate-term evaluation,\nsee Kling, Liebman, and Katz (2007).\n\n10\n\n\x0c', 'then there is no need to estimate a mean, or any other single summary measure of happiness.\n\nThus,\n\nfor example, we might believe that people are (cid:147)not depressed,(cid:148) (cid:147)mildly depressed(cid:148) or\n\n(cid:147)severely depressed(cid:148)and view variation in depression within these categories as unimportant.\n\nWe\n\ntake no position on the accuracy of\n\nthis view of depression, but\n\nif we accept\n\nit, an\n\nintervention that reduces the proportion of severely and mildly depressed individuals reduces\n\ndepression since variation in depression within categories is unimportant. We return to this\n\npoint in our conclusions.\n\nHowever, we believe that happiness should be viewed as continuous. Therefore,\n\nstate-\n\nments about mean happiness and not just the frequency of responses within categories are\n\npotentially relevant. Ludwig et al (2012,\n\ntable S4) report intent-to-treat estimates on the\n\nexperimental group using intervals of 1 unit between the categories, as\n\nis common in the\n\nliterature, but also ordered probit and logit. For purposes of comparison with the literature,\n\nLudwig et al not only show the e⁄ects on the distribution of responses but also consider the\n\ncase where they assign values of 3, 2, and 1 to the three responses.\n\nIn all three cases, they\n\n(cid:133)nd positive e⁄ects on average happiness that fall\n\njust short of signi(cid:133)cance at the .05 level.\n\nIf we believed that happiness is normally distributed, normalizing the cuto⁄s to 0 and 1,\n\nwe would (cid:133)nd that the control group does have a lower mean (.44 v.\n\n.60). But, the control\n\ngroup also has a higher variance (.79 vs .63). The cdfs cross at the 83rd percentile, which\n\nis 1.20 units of happiness (and also in the extreme left tail of the distributions). Thus if we\n\nsimply de(cid:133)ne a new utility function which increases the values of happiness above 1.20 we\n\ncan reverse the mean happiness. This utility function would explain the data equally well.\n\nAlternatively, we can perform an exponential transformation to get a log-normal distri-\n\nbution of happiness. Keeping our underlying cut-points (cid:133)xed at 0 and 1,\n\nthe exponential\n\ntransformation will still show that the experimental group (2.22) is happier than the control\n\ngroup (2.14). But, as discussed in section 2, since the control group has a higher variance of\n\nhappiness, we can raise their mean relative to the experimental group by raising the cut-point\n\nbetween pretty happy and very happy.\n\nIf we raise our cut point to 1:33, or equivalently raise\n\neach individual(cid:146)s happiness to the 1:33rd power after performing the exponential transfor-\n\nmation, the mean utilities of the two groups are equal. As we show in (cid:133)gure 1, this amounts\n\nto a somewhat\n\nright-skewed distribution of happiness, meaning the di⁄erences among the\n\nhappiest\n\nindividuals are greater\n\nthan the di⁄erences among the least happy. This utility\n\nfunction is just a monotonic transformation of the one underlying the normal distribution\n\nand thus (cid:133)ts the data equally well. Therefore, we cannot determine whether the causal e⁄ect\n\nof MTO on happiness is positive on average. One plausible interpretation of the data is that\n\nmoving to a low poverty area reduced both the probability of being extremely unhappy and\n\nextremely happy.\n\n11\n\n\x0c', 'One solution to this\n\nindeterminacy is\n\nto tie our assessment of\n\n(un)happiness\n\nto some\n\nother outcome variable. This is the approach we use in Bond and Lang (2014) where we\n\nscale test scores in a given grade by the eventual educational attainment of students with\n\nthose test scores. The limited number of points on the happiness scale makes this di¢ cult.\n\nThis discreteness may be missing variation within the categories that represents important\n\ndistinctions in happiness. But, compared with variation at the high end of the scale, variation\n\nin happiness at the low end of the scale might prove to be more closely correlated with other\n\nsigns of psychological distress, which were also shown in Ludwig et al\n\nto be bene(cid:133)cially\n\nin(cid:135)uenced by moving to a neighborhood with a lower poverty rate.\n\nThus,\n\nin settings where we do not have direct measures of psychological well-being,\n\nit\n\nmay be possible, we are agnostic on this point,\n\nto use data from other\n\nsettings\n\nsuch as\n\nMTO to scale happiness\n\nin a more compelling way.\n\nFor MTO,\n\nthe strongest evidence of\n\npositive psychological bene(cid:133)ts comes from direct measures of the prevalence of psychological\n\nproblems. Provided that these conditions are discrete rather than continuous, our concerns\n\nabout happiness scales do not apply to such things as measures of depression.\n\n4.2\n\nThe Paradox of Declining Female Happiness\n\nOne surprising result from the happiness literature, documented by Stevenson and Wolfers\n\n(2009),\n\nis that women(cid:146)s happiness appears to have fallen relative to men(cid:146)s from 1972-2006\n\ndespite the great social and economic progress women made during this period. Again, this\n\nresult is easily reversed.\n\nWe use the publicly available (cid:133)le created by Stevenson and Wolfers\n\nfrom the General\n\nSocial Survey (GSS), a nationally representative survey of social attitudes conducted annu-\n\nally or biennially since 1972. The GSS assesses sub jective well being using responses to the\n\nquestion later adopted in the MTO study. While the question remains constant over time,\n\nits position in the survey does not, which could lead to biases in responses in di⁄erent years.8\n\nStevenson and Wolfers use split-ballot experiments to modify the data to account for these\n\ndi⁄erences.9\n\nTo simplify the analysis and ease exposition, we create two subgroups:\n\nthose from the\n\n(cid:133)rst (cid:133)ve surveys (1972-1976) and those from the last (cid:133)ve surveys (1998-2006) but can ob-\n\ntain similar results using the full\n\ntime series. We display the distribution of happiness in\n\nthese groups in Table 2. Using ordered probit, Stevenson and Wolfers found that women\n\n8 For example, Stevenson and Wolfers (2009) note that\nin every year but 1972,\nthe question followed a\nquestion on marital happiness, which may cause di⁄erences\nin the impact of one(cid:146)s marriage on his or her\nresponse to the general happiness assessment. See Smith (1990).\n9 For details of this process, see appendix A of Stevenson and Wolfers (2008b).\n\n12\n\n\x0c', 'lost ground to men at\n\nthe rate of\n\n.376 standard deviations per century. We con(cid:133)rm this\n\nresult between the two subgroups; ordered probit estimates that women were .09 standard\n\ndeviations less happy relative to men in the later sample than the early.\n\nHowever, as discussed previously, ordered probit assumes that the variance of happiness\n\nis constant across sex and over time, an assumption we can easily reject. When we allow the\n\nvariances to di⁄er, we (cid:133)nd women(cid:146)s happiness has more variance than men(cid:146)s and that the\n\nvariance of happiness has declined over time. This is what one would expect from looking\n\nat the data. Most of the di⁄erences between the sexes and over time are due to there being\n\nmore (cid:147)very happy(cid:148)women in the early years. When more people are (cid:147)very happy(cid:148)but there\n\nis no di⁄erence in the number (cid:147)not too happy(cid:148) the distribution must have higher variance\n\nto (cid:133)t the data. Relaxing the constant variance assumption lowers the growth of the gap to\n\n.07.\n\nNow, we transform the utility function by\n\nso that\n\nthe distribution of happiness\n\nis given by the left-skewed log normal distribution.\n\neu = (cid:0)e(cid:0)C u\n\n(8)\n\nSince their utility distribution has\n\nthe highest variance under\n\nthe normality assumption,\n\nchoosing a C su¢ ciently large lowers the mean utility of women in the early period by more\n\nthan it does men(cid:146)s. As we show in in Figure 2, for C (cid:21) 3:9 women become happier over time\nrelative to men, as one might expect given their social progress in the period. Large values\n\nof C will show large increases in relative female happiness.\n\nAdmittedly, when C = 3:9;\n\nthe distribution is fairly skewed. This implies that utility\n\ndi⁄erences among the unhappiest people are far greater than di⁄erences among the happiest.\n\nAll happy people have happiness between 0:02 and 0, while 5% of\n\nthe distribution has\n\nhappiness below (cid:0)250. Of course, this distribution (cid:133)ts the data just as well as the normal.\nFrom the data alone\nit\nis di¢ cult\nto argue\nthat one utility distribution is\nclearly more\n\nplausible.\n\nFurther, this is just one scale and distribution based on a simple transformation under\n\nwhich women gain happiness relative to men. There are an in(cid:133)nite number of others, and\n\nmore complex transformations may create distributions that are more intuitively appealing.\n\nUltimately if we can gain consensus about plausible restrictions on the happiness distribution\n\n(e.g.\n\nskewness, kurtosis) or at least a reasonable loss function involving these moments,\n\nit\n\nmay be possible in some cases to conclude that no plausible transformation will reverse a\n\nparticular (cid:133)nding.\n\n13\n\n\x0c', '4.3\n\nEasterlin Paradox\n\nNo question in the happiness\n\nliterature has\n\nreceived more attention than the (cid:147)Easterlin\n\nParadox,(cid:148) the observation that\n\nin some settings higher\n\nincomes do not appear correlated\n\nwith higher\n\nlevels of happiness.\n\nEasterlin (1973, 1974)\n\nfound that\n\nincome and sub jective\n\nwell-being assessments were strongly and positively correlated within a country in a given\n\nyear, but not over time and across countries. This, and subsequent studies,\n\nled Easterlin\n\n(1994) to conclude, (cid:147)Will raising the incomes of all increase the happiness of all? The answer\n\nto this question can now be given with somewhat greater assurance than twenty years ago.\n\nIt\n\nis (cid:145)no(cid:146).(cid:148) Easterlin instead concludes that the weight of the evidence supports the conclusion\n\nthat individuals judge their happiness relative to their peers and not on an absolute scale.\n\nThe paradox was recently called into question in a comprehensive study by Stevenson\n\nand Wolfers (2008a).10 They use ordered probit both across countries and over time within\n\ncountries and (cid:133)nd a strong relation between happiness and economic development. However,\n\nthey (cid:133)nd that the United States is an exception. Happiness has not increased despite sub-\n\nstantial growth in per capita incomes. They attribute this to the substantial rise in income\n\ninequality over the last 30 years which occurred simultaneously with the rise in real GDP.\n\nWe match the GSS data from Stevenson and Wolfers (2009) with U.S. per capita real\n\ndisposable income data from the 2013 Economic Report of the President to get a time series\n\nof national happiness and income data. Fixing the cut-points to 0 and 1, we estimate the\n\ntwo parameters of a normal distribution for each year using the GSS and regress the means\n\non per capita disposable income. As we show in Figure 3, we do indeed (cid:133)nd an Easterlin\n\nParadox. Ordinary Least Squares estimates imply that a $10,000 per capita increase in real\n\ndisposable income is actually associated with a decrease in happiness in the United States\n\nof\n\n.02 units, although, with a p-value of only .11,\n\nit is not statistically signi(cid:133)cant.\n\nHowever, (cid:133)gure 4 shows that we also estimate a strong negative relation between real per\n\ncapita disposable income and the variance of happiness. A $10,000 increase in per capita\n\nincome is associated with a statistically signi(cid:133)cant .04 unit decrease in the standard deviation\n\nof happiness. This may be somewhat surprising given the increase in income inequality over\n\nthe time period, but is what one would expect from the data and has been demonstrated\n\npreviously by Stevenson and Wolfers (2008b) and Dutta and Foster (2013).11 As real income\n\nhas increased,\n\nfewer people report being very happy, but there is a zero to slightly negative\n\nchange in the number of people who report being not too happy.\n\nsimilar\n\nresults\n\nfrom the Gallup World Poll using OLS on a basic\n\n1 0 See also Deaton (2008) who (cid:133)nds\n10-point scale.\n1 1 Clark, Fleche and Senik (2014,\nhappiness inequality.\n\nforthcoming) argue that\n\nthis\n\nis a standard pattern (cid:150) growth reduces\n\n14\n\n\x0c', 'Since high-income periods have a lower mean and variance\n\nthan low-income periods,\n\nwe know that a left-skewed log normal distribution will\n\nreverse the trend.\n\nIn fact, we do\n\nnot need to skew the distribution that much. For values of C (cid:21) :45 we (cid:133)nd the expected\npositive relationship between income and happiness.\nIn Figure 5, we show the distribution\n\nof happiness under this set of parameters in 2006. Here the cut-point values of happiness\n\nwould be (cid:0)1 to go from not too happy to pretty happy and (cid:0):64 to go from pretty happy\nto very happy. There is variation among the happiest and least happy individuals, although\n\nmore so among the latter given the skewness of the distribution.\n\nFor C > 2, this positive relationship becomes statistically signi(cid:133)cant. We plot the C =\n\n2:05 case\n\nin Figure 6.\n\nHere,\n\na $10,000 increase\n\nin real per\n\ncapita disposable\n\nincome\n\nis\n\nassociated with a :22 unit\n\nincrease in happiness.\n\nIf we are willing to accept\n\nthis amount\n\nof\n\nskewness\n\nin the happiness distribution,\n\nthen raising the\n\nincomes of all does not\n\nraise\n\nthe happiness of all but does\n\nraise average happiness.\n\nThere are other distributions and\n\ntransformations that replicate this result; there is no way to determine from the data which\n\nutility function is correct.\n\nAs in the case of MTO,\n\nif we are convinced that the response categories in the survey are\n\nthe ones that are relevant for policy purposes, we can avoid this problem. However, unlike\n\nthe case of\n\nthe female happiness paradox where it might be possible to conclude that no\n\nplausible happiness distribution would reverse the result, it is evident that plausible (at least\n\nto us) distributions can reverse the basic (cid:133)nding.\n\n4.4\n\nCross-Country Comparisons\n\nIn the previous sections, we found that three conclusions based on normally-distributed hap-\n\npiness assumptions could be reversed by simple log-normal transformations.\n\nIn this subsec-\n\ntion we explore the sensitivity of happiness comparisons to such transformations in general.\n\nUsing data from the World Values Survey, we estimate mean happiness at the country level\n\nfor a normal distribution, as well as a log-normal distribution with C = 2; :5; (cid:0):5; and (cid:0)2.12\nThe ordering of countries in Table 3 represents their happiness ranking when happiness\n\nis distributed normally, and the columns\n\nlist\n\ntheir\n\nranking under\n\nthe di⁄erent\n\nlog-normal\n\ntransformations.\n\nAlthough the actual degree of\n\nskewness varies across\n\ncountries due\n\nto\n\ndi⁄erences in the variance of the underlying normal distribution, moving from left to right\n\nin the columns represents moving from a relatively right-skewed to a relatively left-skewed\n\n1 2 In contrast with the other data we use, the World Values Survey elicits happiness responses on a 4-value\nscale: not at all happy, not very happy, quite happy, and very happy.\nBecause the fraction of not at all\nhappy responses is almost universally trivial, we combine these responses with those of not very happy to\nget a 3-point scale. This allows us to follow the same approach as in the previous three subsections.\n\n15\n\n\x0c', 'distribution.\n\nDoing so has dramatic e⁄ects on the rank-ordering of happiness.\n\nThe (cid:133)ve\n\nhappiest countries when happiness is right-skewed are Ghana, Guatemala, Mexico, Trinidad\n\nand Tobago,\n\nand South Africa.\n\nThree of\n\nthese\n\ncountries\n\nrank in the\n\nbottom ten when\n\nhappiness is left-skewed, and only one (Mexico) ranks in the upper half. The top (cid:133)ve under\n\nthe extreme left-skewed distribution of happiness (New Zealand, Sweden, Canada, Norway,\n\nand Great Britain) fare relatively better under right-skewed happiness, though only Great\n\nBritain remains in the top ten. The rank-correlation between the log-normal transformations\n\nwith C = 2 and C = (cid:0)2 is :156.\nThere are some countries whose rank remains fairly stable throughout the distribution.\n\nGreat Britain is the third happiest country under a normal distribution and has its rank vary\n\nbetween 2 and 8 under the skewed distributions. Moldova, the world(cid:146)s least happy country\n\nunder the normal distribution, is never able to rise above 4th worst in the skewed transforma-\n\ntions. These cases are counterbalanced by countries like Ghana and Ethiopia. Ghana ranges\n\nfrom the world(cid:146)s happiest to the world(cid:146)s 3rd least happy depending on whether happiness is\n\nright- or left-skewed. Ethiopia, the 10th least happy under the normal distribution,\n\nis able\n\nto rise as high as 7th when happiness is right-skewed, placing it above the United States,\n\nAustralia, and Great Britain, among others.\n\nThe wide variation in ranking suggests that in most cases the amount of skewness allowed\n\nin the distribution can have substantial\n\nimpacts on cross-group comparisons. Even the most\n\nskewed-distributions we explored here are not,\n\nto us,\n\nimplausible. They involve a smaller\n\nexponential transformation than required to have a signi(cid:133)cant and positive relationship be-\n\ntween average happiness and per capita income over time in the United States (see (cid:133)gure 5).\n\nWe do (cid:133)nd the ranking under the left-skewed distribution to be more in-line with our priors\n\nthan the right-skew or the normal, though we stress there is nothing in the happiness data\n\nitself that would allow us to choose among the distributions.\n\nInterestingly, the right-skewed\n\ndistributions would imply a strong negative correlation between per capita GDP, while the\n\nleft-skewed implies a strong positive relation.13\n\n5\n\nDiscussion and Conclusions\n\nAs we have demonstrated, key conclusions of happiness studies depend on assumptions about\n\nthe underlying distribution of happiness, something about which the data can give us little\n\nor no guidance. Since the estimated cdfs (almost) always cross when we assume a particular\n\n1 3 Using 2005 data from the IMF on purchasing power parity equivalent per capita GDP, the coe¢ cient\non a regression of estimated mean happiness and the natural\nlogarithm of per capita GDP is -4.79 for the\nright-skewed (C = 2) distribution and .60 for the left-skewed distribution (C = (cid:0)2).\n\n16\n\n\x0c', 'distribution of utility, there is always some transformation that preserves the rank order of\n\nindividuals and changes the direction of the estimated gap in mean happiness.\n\nIs there any way to create compelling cross-group comparisons?\n\nPerhaps the simplest assumption one could make is to assume that we know the policy-\n\nrelevant distribution of happiness. For instance,\n\nif we believe happiness is distributed nor-\n\nmally, we can (cid:133)x the cut-points between "not too happy", "pretty happy", and "very happy"\n\nand estimate the means and variances of each group through ordered probit.\n\nIt should be clear that the choice of a particular distribution almost inevitably implies\n\ntaking a stand on some of the very issues that have been the focus of the happiness litera-\n\nture. Thus since wealth and income are highly skewed, a normal distribution of happiness\n\nwould almost necessarily require the marginal utility of wealth or income to be sharply di-\n\nminishing. We do not, however,\n\nrule out\n\nthe possibility that\n\nthe profession could achieve\n\nnear consensus on some reasonable restrictions on the happiness distribution and that these\n\nrestrictions would be adequate to allow us to reach strong conclusions about the ranking of\n\nmean happiness in some cases.\n\nOf course, there are di¢ culties even if we can rank means. Unless we are very traditional\n\nutilitarians who wish to maximize the sum of utilities, we will still encounter problems for\n\npolicy purposes. We may, many philosophers would argue should, care more about increases\n\nin utility at some parts if the distribution than at others.\n\nIn this case, the Bond and Lang\n\n(2013) criticism of test scores applies directly.\n\nAn alternative solution is to declare the ordinal scale on which people report their hap-\n\npiness\n\nto be\n\nthe policy-relevant one.\n\nGroup A is happier\n\nthan group B if\n\nits members\n\nresponses (cid:147)stochastically dominate(cid:148) B(cid:146)s using the categories provided in the question about\n\nself-assessed happiness. This approach has a great deal of\n\nintuitive appeal, and we confess\n\nthat in some cases we are inclined to accept it. However,\n\nit is trivial to (cid:133)nd examples where,\n\nusing what appears to be a sensible partition of the data into three categories, groups appear\n\nto be ordered in the sense of stochastic dominance, but for which the means have the re-\n\nverse order when the full underlying distribution is examined. For example, there are many\n\noccupations (e.g.\n\nactors)\n\nin which mean income is relatively high but most people in the\n\noccupation have very low incomes. Other occupations have high variance but also relatively\n\nlow mean wages. When stochastic dominance fails using the full underlying distribution,\n\nit\n\nis possible to group wages (or other variables) so that using the grouped data,\n\nstochastic\n\ndominance appears to hold.\n\nOf course, as the number of response categories becomes large,\n\nit becomes less plausible\n\nthat a (cid:133)ner grid would reverse the conclusion that the group that appears to be happier in\n\nthe sense of stochastic dominance has higher mean happiness.\n\nIn the experiment described\n\n17\n\n\x0c', 'earlier, Oswald asked participants\n\nto report\n\ntheir height on a continuous\n\nscale from 0 to\n\n10. Assuming that there are no responses at the extreme,\n\nif all respondents use the same\n\nreporting function, then stochastic dominance is su¢ cient to ensure that the ranking of the\n\nmeans\n\nis\n\nindependent of\n\nscale.\n\nIt\n\nseems\n\nto us\n\nlikely that\n\nif\n\nindividual di⁄erences\n\nin the\n\nreporting function are independent of group membership, (cid:133)rst order stochastic dominance\n\nwill\n\nstill be su¢ cient\n\nto rank means. However, we note that Oswald (cid:133)nds evidence that\n\nmen and women use di⁄erent reporting functions when converting their height to his scale.\n\nIt\n\nis also not evident\n\nthat\n\nrepeated observations on the same individuals will address\n\nthe\n\nproblem of heterogeneity in the response function.\n\nIn addition to the well-known problems\n\nassociated with estimating (cid:133)xed e⁄ects with ordinal data,\n\nit\n\nis not clear\n\nthat we expect\n\nindividual reporting functions to be stable over time. For example, in repeated cross-sections,\n\nimmigrants\n\nshow no improvement\n\nin their host-country language\n\nskills, but\n\nthey report\n\nimprovement when asked to compare their current and earlier language skills (Berman, Lang\n\nand Siniver, 2003).\n\nOne solution when working with ordinal scales is to relate them to some measurable out-\n\ncome.\n\nIn the traditional economics literature, we measure the utility of a good or outcome by\n\nwillingness to pay,\n\nimperfectly captured by the equivalent or compensating variation. The\n\nhappiness literature has called this approach into question and with it some basic assump-\n\ntions, such as positive marginal utility of money.\n\nInvoking a monetary scale thus brings us\n\nto a Catch-22. We cannot answer the main questions of the happiness literature using the\n\nmost obvious tool because the literature seeks to invalidate that very tool.\n\nFinally, we note that our examples require di⁄erent transformations to reverse the results\n\nin the literature. We showed that moving to a low poverty area reduces mean happiness if\n\nhappiness is log normally distributed and strongly right skewed. But the Easterlin paradox\n\nis\n\nresolved for\n\nthe United States\n\nif happiness\n\nfollows a su¢ ciently left-skewed log normal\n\ndistribution.\n\nIt\n\nis not obvious\n\nthat\n\nthere\n\nis an assumption about\n\nthe distribution that\n\nwould reverse both results.\n\nIt may be that we can reach su¢ cient consensus about which\n\ndistributions are acceptable that we can make de(cid:133)nitive statements in some cases.\n\nOne possibility is what we call the (cid:147)Tolstoy assumption,(cid:148)that there is far greater variation\n\nin unhappiness than in happiness.14\n\nIn other words, happiness is left skewed.\n\nIn this case,\n\nit\n\nis very likely that MTO did raise happiness\n\nfor\n\nthose who moved to less\n\nimpoverished\n\nareas.\n\nThis\n\nis consistent with the standard assumption that expanding the choice set of\n\nrational agents should never ex ante decrease utility. But before drawing strong conclusions,\n\nwe should be explicit about the requisite assumptions.\n\n1 4We apologize to lovers of Russian literature for\nthis deliberate misinterpretation of Anna Karenina (cid:150)\n(cid:147)All happy families are alike; each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.(cid:148)\n\n18\n\n\x0c', 'References\n\n[1] Berman, Eli, Kevin Lang and Erez Siniver,\n\n2003.(cid:147)Language-Skill Complementarity:\n\nReturns to Immigrant Language Acquisition,(cid:146)Labour Economics, 10 (3): 265-90.\n\n[2] Clarke, Andrew E., Sarah Fleche and Claudia Senik,\n\nforthcoming.
